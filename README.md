The goal of pmxNODE is to facilitate the implementation of neural
ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in pharmacometric software,
i.e., Monolix, NONMEM, and nlmixr2.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pmxNODE like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("braemd/pmxNODE")
```

## How to use

#### General workflow

The general workflow of pmxNODE consists of few steps:

- Write a structural model, as you would do normaly for Monolix, NONMEM,
  or nlmixr2. However, you can utilize NN functions in your model code,
  e.g., for complex or unknown model parts.

- Convert the written model file with the `nn_converter_XXX` function
  from the pmxNODE package, e.g. `nn_converter_mlx` for Monolix. This
  function can also directly generate a *.mlxtran* file with
  automatically initialized model parameters.

- We suggest to fit the model to the data first without inter-individual
  variability on neural networks parameters (argument *pop = True* in
  the `nn_converter_mlx` function) and add the random effects in a
  second run, where parameters were initialized with last estimates.

#### NN functions

The NN functions in your structural model do need to be of following
form:

- They must be named in order to uniquely identify them in the model
  (e.g., if the same NN is used to outflow of an absorption compartment
  and as inflow into the central compartment) and to generate uniquly
  identifiable parameters.

- The following arguments are mandatory:

  - `state`: Defines the state that goes into the NN
  - `min_init`: The minimal expected input into the NN
  - `max_init`: The maximal expected input into the NN The minimal and
    maximal expected inputs are needed to properly initialize the
    weights of the NN. They don’t need to be exact but should roughly
    give the range of expected inputs.

- The following arguments are optional:

  - `n_hidden`: Number of units in the hidden layer. Default is 5.
  - `act`: Activation function to be used in the hidden layer.
    Currently, only “ReLU” and “Softplus” are available. Default is
    “ReLU”.
  - `time_nn`: Whether the NN should be a “Time-dependent NN” according
    to <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-023-09886-4>, i.e., whether the
    weights from input to hidden layer should be negative. Default is
    FALSE.

#### Package loading and initialization

We first need to load the pmxNODE package and to initialize the
lixoftConnectors package (can be done with the `software_initializer`
function from pmxNODE).

If the lixoftConnectors package is not yet installed, an installation
path to the package .tar.gz file from Monolix must be provided.

``` r
library(pmxNODE)
library(ggplot2)
#> Warning: Paket 'ggplot2' wurde unter R Version 4.2.3 erstellt
software_initializer(software = "Monolix",
                     mlx_path = "C:/ProgramData/Lixoft/MonolixSuite2021R2")
#> Lade nötiges Paket: RJSONIO
#> [INFO] The lixoftConnectors package has been successfully initialized:
#> lixoftConnectors package version -> 2021.2
#> Lixoft softwares suite version   -> 2021R2
```

#### Examples

Some examples are available in the pmxNODE package. To see all example
files, you can use the `get_example_list` function. To copy an example
to a folder of your choice, you can use the `copy_example` function.
After calling the `copy_examples` function, two files should be in the
target folder, a data file and a Monolix model file.

``` r
get_example_list()

copy_examples(
  target_folder = "~/pmxNODE",
  example_nr = 1,
  example_software = "Monolix"
)
```

#### Converting and population fit

Before fitting the model, it needs to be converted with the
`nn_converter_mlx` function. In addition to the path/file name of the
unconverted Monolix model and the argument on including inter-individual
variability for the neural network parameters, a Monolix *.mlxtran* file
can be automatically generated with the *gen_mlx_file = TRUE* argument.
In order to do so, a data file and the header types must be provided. If
no file name for the new Monolix file is given through the *mlx_name*
argument, the Monolix file name is automatically generated based on the
Monolix model file. Note that a suffix is added to the file name, either
*\_pop* if *pop = TRUE* or *\_ind* if *ind = TRUE*.

The model can be automatically run from R with the function `run_mlx`
from the pmxNODE package.

``` r
nn_converter_mlx(mlx_path = "~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1_model.txt",
                 pop = TRUE,
                 gen_mlx_file = TRUE,
                 mlx_name = "~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1",
                 data_file = "~/pmxNODE/data_example1_mlx.csv",
                 header_types = c("id","time","amount","observation"))

run_mlx("~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1_pop.mlxtran")
```

#### Converting and individual fit

In order to get the parameter estimations from the population fit
(without inter-individual variability), the `pre_fixef_extractor_mlx`
function can be utilized.

These parameter estimates can be given as additional argument
*pre_fixef* to the `nn_converter_mlx` function. To include
inter-individual variability, the population argument is set to false
(*pop = FALSE*) in the `nn_converter_mlx` function.

The final model with inter-individual variability can then be fitted
again with the `run_mlx` function.

``` r
est_parms <- pre_fixef_extractor_mlx("~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1_pop.mlxtran")

nn_converter_mlx(mlx_path = "~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1_model.txt",
                 pop = FALSE,
                 pre_fixef = est_parms,
                 gen_mlx_file = TRUE,
                 mlx_name = "~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1",
                 data_file = "~/pmxNODE/data_example1_mlx.csv",
                 header_types = c("id","time","amount","observation"))

run_mlx("~/pmxNODE/mlx_example1_ind.mlxtran")
```
